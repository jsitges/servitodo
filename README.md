This project is the MVP for a personal project called Servitodo. The goal of the app is to help professionals in under-developed countries that have been affected by COVID-19 get leads to jobs. If you would like to see me demo the app click [here](https://www.loom.com/share/0782c7ff097e49c3ab2d8b0e3e2b8817).
